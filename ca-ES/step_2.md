Start with a `sphere` with a radius of `10` (the unit here is millimetres):

Click on the **Render** button to see the result.

Tip: you can change the colour of the rendered model by clicking on the coloured square.

Now stretch the sphere along its Y axis to create an elongated body for the bug.

The `scale`{:class="blockscadtransforms"} block allows you to stretch or squash objects along the X, Y, and Z axes. Set the Y value to `1.2` to stretch the sphere along the Y axis.

Click **Render** again and check that the sphere has been stretched into an ellipsoid. Look at your model from different angles so you can see how it has changed.

Tip: every time you make a change to the code, you need to click **Render** to see the results.

Now squash the ellipsoid a bit along the z-axis to make a flatter bug.

Setting an axis value below `1` makes the object smaller along that axis. So change the Z value in the `scale`{:class="blockscadtransforms"} block to `0.8`.
