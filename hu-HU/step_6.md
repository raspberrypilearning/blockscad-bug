## Challenge: design your own bug

--- challenge ---

Now it's time to design your own bug using your new knowledge of BlocksCAD!

Tips:

+ Most 3D printers can only print in one colour. You can use colours in BlocksCAD to design the look you want and then add details with permanent marker pens after printing.

+ Don't make any part of your bug too slim, or it will break easily.

+ Avoid adding parts that have gaps below them when they are 3D printed, because 3D printers can't print in mid-air. (It is possible to print using supports to hold up parts of your model, but this makes printing more complicated.)

+ Think about how big your bug will be. If you make it too big, then it will take a long time to print and use a lot of filament.
