## Introduction

In this project, you will use BlocksCAD to design a 3D bug or insect using geometric shapes.

If you have access to a 3D printer, you can print the bug you design. Once your bug is printed, you can add details using permanent marker pens.

You'll also be able to use the skills you have learned to design your own bug or other creature using geometric shapes.

The bugs make great rewards for debugging!

### What you will make

The finished bug looks like this:

If you have access to a 3D printer, you can print your bug and then decorate it.

Most 3D printers can only print in one colour, so you can add details using permanent markers to make your bug look even better.
