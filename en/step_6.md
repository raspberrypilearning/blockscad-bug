## Challenge: Design your own bug

--- challenge ---

Now it's time to design your own bug using the techniques you have learned. 

Tips:
+ Don't make any part of your bug too delicate or it will break easily. 

+ Avoid parts that will have gaps underneath when 3D printing them - 3D printers can't print in mid-air. (It is possible to print using support to hold up parts of your model but it may make printing more complicated.)
