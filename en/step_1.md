## Introduction

In this project you will use BlocksCAD to design a 3D printable bug or insect using geometric shapes.

The resulting bug can be 3D printed if you have access to a 3D printer. Once your bug is printed you can add details using a permanent marker pen.

The bugs make great rewards for debugging. 

You'll also use the skills you have learned to have a go at designing your own bug, insect or other creature using geometric shapes. 

### What you will make

The finished bug looks like this:

If you have access to a 3D printer you can print and decorate your bug.

Most 3D printers can only print in one colour. You can add details using a permanent marker to make your bug more interesting.
