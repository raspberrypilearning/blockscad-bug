## Add a head

Now let's add a head to the bug. 

--- task ---
Add a smaller sphere to create the bug's head. 

You'll need a `union` block to combine the head and body.

This sphere is also scaled.

You won't be able to see the sphere because it's hidden inside the body. If you want to see it then you can temporarily disable the body by right-clicking on the `scale` block and choosing 'Disable block'. The block and those inside it will be greyed out and the body will not appear when you click `Render`.

Right-click on the block again and choose `Enable block` to bring it back.

The head needs to be translated along the Y axis so that it sticks out in front of the body.

It's also useful to change the colour of the head so that you can clearly see the different shapes. You can also experiment with different colour combinations for decorating your printed bug with permanent markers.

Can you change the colour of the body of your bug using code? You could change it to the colour of the filament you will be printing with, or to the colour of the permanent marker you will colour it with.
