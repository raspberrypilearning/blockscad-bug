## Create legs

Now the bug needs six legs!

First put a pair of legs in the middle of the bug's body.  

Click the `+` at the top of the `union` block to add another section. Add a stretched `sphere` to create a pair of legs.

If you like, you can disable the body of the bug to see how the legs are made.

Then enable the body again to continue working on your bug.

Now add another pair of legs.

Add another `scaled` `sphere` with the same settings. Then `rotate` it by `30` degress along the Z axis so the legs stick out at an angle.
